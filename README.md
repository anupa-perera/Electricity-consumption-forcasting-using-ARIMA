# Power-consumption-analysis-using-ARIMA

Demand for energy has been increasing worldwide over the past half a century, as incomes are rising and populations are growing. Electricity consumption has more than tripled between 1980 and 2021, as a result of the development of power-intensive industries, living conditions and appliance and efficiency standards. That’s why several countries, in particular economically advanced countries, have been looking for ways to improve energy efficiency, hence decrease their energy consumption. It is possible for businesses to reduce their operations costs and the environmental impacts by cutting down their energy consumption. For that purpose, collection and analysis of data is needed to identify areas of improvement. Data showing the evolution of the electricity consumption between January 2011 and December 2014 in a hotel in Cuba1 is available in the Excel file “Hotel A Data.xlsx”. This data was collected during the implementation of energy efficiency measures within an energy management system. A solution has been implemented using ARIMA to forcast future electricity consumption for this hotel.
